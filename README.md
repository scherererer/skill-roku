## Roku
Interfaces with roku

## Description 
This is a mycroft skill for controlling your roku. It uses the Roku External Control API found here: https://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/External+Control+API

When you ask your mycroft to play a show, this skill will do a search at the "roku" level for the show. If it finds what you are looking for on the correct provider (e.g. netflix, amazon, etc.) then it will launch it automatically. If it doesn't, you'll end up with some search results on your screen.

## Examples 
* "Show altered carbon on netflix"

## Testing
Tested using a Roku 3.
